Mitsui Construction Company Lanka (PVT) Ltd was established in May 1984, under FIAC authorization to take over civil construction work. In December 1985, the FIAC authorization was extended to include the leasing / hiring of industrial equipment. In April 1988, Mitsui Construction Company Lanka (PVT) Ltd changed its name to Sanken Lanka (PVT) Ltd. The shareholders of company are Singha Holdings Ltd – 51%, Mitsui Construction Co Ltd – 39%; and Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd – 10%. In June 1988, Sanken Lanka obtained foreign construction work as well as to take over the employment of staff for such foreign construction work. Whilst in June 1988, the FIAC approvals were extended to cover the additional activities of the construction of Middle and Upper Class Houses as well as Commercial Complexes. Then in March 1991, approval was obtained for the sale of ready mixed concrete. With the benefit of the Mitsui connection, Sanken Lanka has established itself over the years as a leader in the field of civil construction. In May 2003, with the manager of Mitsui Construction with Sumitomo Corporation, there was a change in ownership, where the new shareholders were also the new Directors namely Messrs Mahen Weeraskera (70%), Ranjith Gunatileke (20%), and Yosuke Tahara (10%). The company has a grade M1 for building construction. So it is the great qualification for award the massive construction tenders. In the past, there were some problems due to lack of building projects. Anyway now some projects are received. Sanken Lanka has a good establishment of constructing, estimating, project planning and quantity surveying. However each of these functions is versatile and complex in nature and board perspective can be described as follows. Planning of construction activities as completion the project within the target duration, 6 estimating and controlling the recourse allocations. Periodical monitoring of progress of work during the construction stage to identify any deviation from the set targets and taking remedial measures catch up on short falls. Keeping in touch with inflow of funds, collecting advanced payment, retentions and value of bonds. Updating the contract value by adopting ICTAD specified price fluctuation methods. Preparation of rate analysis for each activities involved in the construction industry using formal B.S.R., IDTAD statistics and research and work studies. Allocation of limited machinery, equipments, materials, direct labors to avoid the short coming and delays. Collecting local rates from sub-contractors, which are having satisfactory labor force and engage them in construction site to gain the profitable service.

I did much work in this site and a list of these works with a brief description is shown below: ‣ Monitoring demolition works in the old building. It is done with using an electric heavy duty breaker. Fig.03 &amp; 04: demolition work ‣ Monitoring the block work in the site. In some areas in the site, it is wanted to build some walls or part of the wall. In our site, it is used hollow blocks which have 200mm width. And it is used cement mortar, prepared by mixing cement and sand in 1:5 proportions with adding water. Fig.05: block work ‣ Monitoring the concrete work which used to construct the concrete stage to keep the electric panel. Fig.06 &amp; 07: concrete work ‣ Checking the curing work. After concreting the floor, it should be kept 2 or 3 days to curing. Fig. 08 &amp; 09: curing ‣ Monitoring the plastering walls. After block work, cement plaster is used as the protection of wall. In my site it is used cement and sand with 1:5 ratios. ‣ Monitoring the painting works. In my site, it is applied pre-coat layers on plastered wall. After one layer of pre-coat it should be smoothed the wall using sand papers. Then it can be applying filler on the wall. After doing this work some times to remove the patches on the wall, it can be applied color paints. Fig.10: applying pre-coat Fig.11: smoothing wall ‣ Monitoring the tiling work. In our site, it is used wall and floor tiles and granite tiles. Fig.12: wall tiling Fig.13: granite tiling ‣ Checking the expansion joint construction. Using grinder, it is made a drain which has 20mm width &amp; 40mm depth. Then it should be cleaned the drain until removing the dust and then put the closed cell polyethylene joint breaker rods in to the drain and push down. After that it is applied primer on two walls of drain with using small brush. And then, poured the sealant on the rod until remaining the 10mm (half of the width of the drain) from the top level. Then it can be installed the expansion joint cover plate and kept some weights on it to stick well. ‣ Monitoring the ceiling work. In my site, it is used aluminum T-bars as ceiling frames. As well as in bath rooms it was used aluminum ceiling sheets and other parts it was used metal fiber ceiling sheets. Fig.14: metal fiber ceiling sheets Fig.15: aluminum ceiling sheets ‣ Checked the finishing works in bathrooms like sensor tape, tank fitting and toilets installation etc. Fig. 16 &amp; 17: sensor taps and toilet fittings ‣ Measured and prepared the measurement sheets for granite tiled areas, painting areas etc. 4.0 WORKING EXPERIENCE In this expansion project, I got over all knowledge about demolition works and finishing works. 4.1 DEMOLITION In this site it has to demolish many concrete walls and floors. In here, it will be needed to use powerful equipment and always take proper safety precautions when doing demolition of concrete floors and walls because concrete is very stable and hard to remove. 4.1.1 BREAKING AND REMOVING THE CONCRETE FLOORS &amp; WALLS Before using tools to breaking concrete, it has to wear safety equipment. Power tools are required to this section which will be working with rough materials, so it is necessary that workers keep protected. Earplugs, a hard hat and safety goggles should be wanted to wear. It is important to protect ears and head where tools will be used to break up concrete can be very noisy and could actually cause pieces to fly up from the ground. To avoid inhaling dangerous substances, it will also need to wear a face mask both to protect the mouth. And also, it should be wanted to wear tough boots and tough clothing with long sleeves and legs to protect skin. The workers who will be handling rough pieces of concrete should be aware of and protect from loose debris. And <a href="javascript:openDSC(352807773, 1390, '457');" onmouseover="doRollover(4);" onmouseout="undoRollover(4);" id="457" name="4" style="color:brown" class="brown"><span class="b-ref">4</span>if there any services such as electricity, water, gas, communication cables etc. running below or near the concrete<span> floor or wall </span>to be broken up,</a> so it should be identify potential risk areas and determined. It should be completely cleared if there are any of these. It is a best way to remove large concrete parts which is to break it up into several smaller pieces. And this makes not easier to remove the concrete but also to makes it easier to discard the old floors &amp; walls. The best way to start at the side that is farthest away from worker so, to break the concrete, it should be stand on the solid, flat concrete that hasn’t been broken yet. It is started with the point of the breaker touching the cement and then switches the tool on. The tool vibrating will be getting started because of hammering the point into the cement hundreds of times per minute. Holding the breaker firmly and upright and let the point crack and break the surface of the slab is extremely important that workers have a solid place to stand and that have good footing while they are using the breaker. It should be held the tool firmly and perfectly upright. If its’ don’t, it may begin to move to one side or the other and become harder to control. When this same problem also be appear and if it is applied too much pressure to it, so hold it firmly, but do not push down on it too hard. And it is very important to work slowly and carefully and let the breaker do the work and also rushing or trying to force the tool into the concrete can be dangerous. It should be never push the breaker into the concrete in a diagonal direction or use it as a lever because this could cause damage and could be dangerous. And also it is very important to keep the power cord behind the work place and is not near the point of the breaker. If a good tip is to look for cracks and broken pieces of concrete and work the breaker along that then this will make it much easier to break up the concrete. It can also be helpful to pause periodically and remove concrete debris. The best approach is to break the concrete up in the pattern of a grid and as long as they are small enough to remove and discard of. It can be broken up into any size of pieces as necessary. Whenever the breaker is turned off, it should be held until it is completely turned off and no longer moving before putting down it. It can be used a wrecking bar to break it into even smaller pieces where necessary after broken up the concrete floor. Then, a shovel is used to scoop the concrete pieces into a skip and a push broom to sweep up smaller pieces and dust. With using a heavy-duty breaker, concrete breaking and removing is large works and it can be done with the right tools, safety precautions and some planning.

This bonding agent and the blocks should be strong enough to give stronger walls. Motor is the commonly using bonding agent. So the block and the mortar are the most important items of a block wall. 4.2.2 MORTAR Mortar is mixture of cement &amp; sand. It is used for to bind the individual blocks to form the whole wall a compact mass. It can have many kind of in various proportions. In our site it is used 1:5 cement and sand for walls. Mortar is mixed by hand or mortar mixer, in our site used hand mixer. 4.2.3 BLOCKS There were two types of cellular blocks whose dimensions were 200mm x 190mm x 390mm and 100mm x 190mm x 390mm (hollow blocks). Blocks were made of cement and aggregates mixed in correct proportions with relevant SLS certificates. Blocks are extensively used for both load bearing &amp; non load bearing walls.

The bonding agent mostly used in construction industry as the paste of cement and water. Mainly it fills the voids among aggregates and also it provides lubrication to the freshly mixed concrete. In the ultimate state this causes the concrete to gain strength. In such a way, the concrete should be selected that is suits to the purpose. In selecting, combining and mixing materials should be complying with the purpose which needs special qualities of the concrete. Ordinary Portland cement is the most commonly used cement in concrete. And the bulk of volume of concrete is aggregates which provide cheap filling material for the cement paste, resist abrasion and wear and reduce volume changes in the process of hardening. 4.3.2 THE PRIMARY OPERATIONS OF CONCRETING ‣ Batching Concrete for usual purposes would have a mix determined by arbitrary standard, and for work involved in greater importance the mix could be designed, usually the coarse and fine aggregates are taken in the proportion of 2:1 and the popular types of mixtures are 1:2:4 and 1:3:6 the proportioning of materials should be done by either volume or by weight. But rather than <a href="javascript:openDSC(444429953, 1, '2549');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="2549" name="1" style="color:red" class="red"><span class="b-ref">1</span>volume of cement and aggregate<span> varied </span>with the degree of compaction and also<span> in case of </span>sand</a> due to bulking. And also, batching is done by mechanical means for the ready-mix concrete. ‣ <a href="javascript:openDSC(444429953, 1, '2552');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="2552" name="1" style="color:red" class="red"><span class="b-ref">1</span>Mixing Of Concrete The cement, sand and aggregates are mixed such that the ingredients are uniformly distributed in the concrete mass. There are two types of concrete mixing namely, ? Hand mixing ? Machine mixing Hand Mixing The hand mixing should be used for small jobs. The mixing is done on a level, clean and non-porous floor or board. Firstly the sand measured</a> and <a href="javascript:openDSC(444429953, 1, '2558');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="2558" name="1" style="color:red" class="red"><span class="b-ref">1</span>spread on the board in a layer and required cement is spread<span> on </span>it</a> the above mentioned proportioned. <a href="javascript:openDSC(444429953, 1, '2562');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="2562" name="1" style="color:red" class="red"><span class="b-ref">1</span>Two men mix these two materials with<span> using </span>shovels.</a> And the <a href="javascript:openDSC(444429953, 1, '2564');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="2564" name="1" style="color:red" class="red"><span class="b-ref">1</span>whole ingredient is mixed thoroughly as evenly as possible.<span> Then </span>the</a> water is spread gradually and shoveled. The whole mixture <a href="javascript:openDSC(444429953, 1, '2566');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="2566" name="1" style="color:red" class="red"><span class="b-ref">1</span>is turned over in this manner at least 03 times while dry and again at least 03 times while water added. If water is added at once the portion of</a><a href="javascript:openDSC(444429953, 1, '2569');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="2569" name="1" style="color:red" class="red"><span class="b-ref">1</span>mix dry. Therefore<span> it </span>must be taken<span> great care </span>to ensure that the whole mix uniformly absorbs the added water. Machine Mixing<span> The </span>machine mixing<span> is </span>the speed of rotation of the drum and the duration of mixing affect the quality of concrete.</a>‣ Transport Of Concrete Concrete should be transported where it has to be placed as rapidly as possible by a method, which prevents the segregation or loss of ingredients. When concrete have to be lifted for high-level differences, Hoist machine was used for it. ‣ Placing And Compacting Concrete The main thing, which should be taken care in placement of concrete, is to ensure that initial setting has not started. This time for ordinary Portland cement is 45 minutes. When it is put concrete in to the big area of a slab or a base, it is done part by part. If the first concrete sample was put in to the one place, second sample must be put little bit far away, then the third one to be done in the same way. It is very important to remember, before passing the initial setting time the next concrete sample should be placed in to above places. The ultimate strength of the concrete is increased by proper placement. 31 Manual system or pumping system is used for the placement of the concrete. Whatever the method which is adopted, it should be confirm that the continuity supply of the mix during the placement of the concrete. To <a href="javascript:openDSC(415165693, 1, '2700');" onmouseover="doRollover(9);" onmouseout="undoRollover(9);" id="2700" name="9" style="color:#330099" class="#330099"><span class="b-ref">9</span>achieve maximum strength<span> the concrete </span>must be compacted.

Plastering was the art of covering to surfaces with a plastic material to obtain an even, smooth, regular, clean and durable surface. There are various types of plasters used. In my site cement plaster was used. Ratio of mixture of the cement plaster is 1:5cement: sand. Usually thickness of plastering is 15mm. The principle objects of plastering were, ‣ To provide a true, even, smooth and finished surface to the work and improve the appearance. ‣ To protect the surfaces from harmful effects of atmospheric influences ‣ To cover up unsound and porous materials. ‣ To cover defective workmanship. ‣ To give suitable ground for white wash, color wash, distemper or paint. Plastering covers the defective workmanship and covers up unsound and cheap quality material. Always, plastering was required to provide a satisfactory base for decorating the surface by whitewashing, color washing, distempering or painting. External plastering also named as “rendering” was done with the object of improving the resistance of the surface to rain water penetration and other atmospheric influences. The following factors are affected the selection of the type of plaster to be used: ‣ Availability of binding materials. ‣ Desired durability and finish. ‣ The place where the plaster is going to be used. ‣ Atmospheric conditions to which the plaster would subject. The plasters normally contain a binding material, fine aggregates and water. Sometime, special additives are mixed into the plaster for improving the appearance or the adhesion. Plastering can be divided two categories, ‣ Internal plaster - A smooth surface is provided by the internal plastering, in which dust and dirt are liable to adhere much. And also the surface is not affected by vermin and forms a good base for applying color wash, distemper or paint. ‣ External plaster - Covering the surfaces is the main object of external plastering which protect from rain and other weathering agencies besides concealing defective workmanship and inferior materials. 4.5.2 FACTORS WERE CONSIDERED BEFORE PLASTERING ‣ Cleaned the selected area without timber parts &amp; nails. ‣ Removed honeycombs at the wall. ‣ Chipped extra concrete surfaces &amp; loose concrete particles ‣ Tirod holes are filling from polyform on the wall for plastering. Then applied the chemifix to them. ‣ After doing that, leave those holes about 5 min. then using 1:2 cement: sand mixture for close them. ‣ Placed chicken mesh to edges of connecting of block wall and concrete wall. ‣ Finished Electrical &amp; plumbing work. ‣ Removed oil or paint surfaces. ‣ Accreted all doors &amp; windows position ‣ The walls must be well washed, cleaned and kept wet for at least one hour before the plaster is applied. 4.5.3 PLACING GUIDE POINTS Fig.27: Method of placing guide points on plumb out walls 4.5.4 EQUIPMENTS USE FOR PLASTERING Level Bar: Level Bar is used to make surface vertical. It is used to checked plaster whether it is finished correctly. It should be long enough to keep between two gauges. And it should be straight. Tri square: Tri square is used to check the revels and corners of plaster. Using it can make right angles in corners for checked plaster finish. Plum Bob: Plum bob is used to maintain vertically during block. In internal plastering work is used to make spot level gauge and level preparation also. But in external plaster we don’t use it. Sponge Piece: Sponge piece are used to make final plaster using this make a smooth surface. 4.5.5 DEFECTS IN PLASTERING Cracks: - Plastered surface may be developing cracks that may thin hairline cracks, or wide open cracks. If the cracks are not easily noticeable, they are not considered as defects. The development of thin hair cracks is known as “crazing” and it may be due to some reasons such as, ‣ Finished surface being very smooth, normally rough finished surfaces cracks less than smooth finished surfaces. ‣ Excessive thickness of plasters causing excessive shrinkage. ‣ Expansion or shrinkage of the plaster itself during drying. ‣ Movement due to expansion or shrinkage of backing materials. 4.5.6 REMEDIES FOR PLASTERING DEFECTS To minimize defects, the following measures should be employed, ? The surface which have to plastered should be properly prepared and well watered before the plaster is laid over it. This is help to prevent absorption of water from plaster. ? The finished surface of the plaster should not be toweled excessively. ? The quality of the blocks used for construction must be good. ? It has to use the water that free from soluble salt. Alternatively a solution of 1 part of hydrochloric or sulfuric acid with 4 or 5 parts of water may be prepared and applied on the affected area with brushes. The surface has to 38 finally be washed with clean water. 4.6 WATER PROOFING 4.6.1 INTRODUCTION The main target of the water proofing is that prevent the water going through the concrete. When constructing the building, water proofing is most important. In my site it was done various places. 4.6.2 WATER PROOFING MATERIALS It is used some materials for the water proofing work. Some of them are as following, ? Construction grout ? Xypex ? Baralastic 4.6.2.1 Construction <a href="javascript:openDSC(2744266467, 1840, '1163');" onmouseover="doRollover(14);" onmouseout="undoRollover(14);" id="1163" name="14" style="color:#9c6331" class="#9c6331"><span class="b-ref">14</span>Grout Construction Grout is ready to<span> used cementations </span>grout with selected, graded natural<span> aggregate </span>for use in general civil engineering works.<span> There is no </span>mixing with the specified quantity of water<span> and </span>it provides a grout with high strength<span> characteristic </span>and<span> expended </span>working time.

Xypex<span> primary</span><span>’s </span>and most distinguishing performance feature is its unique ability to generate a non-soluble crystalline formation<span> with </span>deep within the pores and capillary tracts of the concrete- a crystalline structure that permanently<span> seal </span>the concrete against the penetration of water and other<span> liquid </span>from any direction. Xypex<span> crystallizes </span>products are dry powder<span> compound </span>composed of Portland cement, silica sand and many active proprietary chemicals.<span> The Places That </span>Xypex</a> Can Use • Concrete foundation • Concrete roof &amp; walls • Concrete water tanks • Concreted drains • Concreted damp Properties • It is a dry cement dust • It is stopped the leakages in concrete surfaces • It can be used mixing with water Application • Clean the surface free from dust ,oil and other components • Get the true measurements of the surface • If there is cracking places repair them using construction grout • If there are gullies and other water supplying pipes repair around those places using construction grout. 4.6.3 WATER PROOFING AREAS 4.6.3.1 Underground Water Proofing • Cleaned the existing surface to be free from dust, cement parts, grout deposits, etc. • Repaired honey-combs and weak areas (if any) with non-shrink, high strength repair grout • Applied XYPEX in two coats as manufacturers specification • Cured the application for 03 days • Checked for water leakages • Protected the water proof areas with 1:3 cement sand 25mm thick screed layer. 4.6.3.2 Toilets Water Proofing Work • Cleaned the selected surface to be free from dust, cement laitance, grout deposits, etc. • Repaired the construction joints, seal around the gullies and pipe protrusion. • Lay 1:3 cement: sand screed to slop toward the gullies. Plaster finishes rough on walls in the toilet area. • From 1:3 cement: sand 25mmx25mm angle fillets at all right angle edges. • Apply two coats of BARALASTIC water proofing system strictly according to manufactures specification. Reinforced all vertical and horizontal intersection with GLASCOTE 60 in strip 200mm wide. • Cure the application for 2 days. • Check for water leakages. • Protect water proof area with 1:3cement: sand screed layers. 4.7 PAINTING 4.7.1 INTRODUCTION The major purpose of paint is to provide a decorative finish to obtain clean and colorful surfaces. Such surfaces are hygienically good, presence healthy surrounding to live in. The outside of walls need painting for protects the surface from environmental factors. Surfaces are generally painted with several coats of paints, each coat performing a specific function. These series of coats of paint is known as “painting system”. The process of painting consists of three coats. They were, ? Primary coat. ? Under coat or body coat. ? Finishing coat. 4.7.2 PRIMARY COAT Primer coat is the first coat of paint that applies on the surface. This is applied on the surface to suitable to the background and to bond with the surface. This primer should have a good spreading ability when applying on plastered surfaces. A good feature of the primer is that and it should have a penetrating ability to the plastered surface. But part of it must remain on the surface after absorption. Generally this primer coat should withstand the temperature and it should bond with other paints well. Fig.28: applying pre-coat 4.7.3 UNDER COAT OR BODY COAT The primary coat and well bond with other paint coats and remain as an ordinary paint coat under coat covers. The most important thing of the under coat relates to the filling properties, color and support for the finishing coat. Heavy under coats are generally not 42 allowed and hence suitable thinning agents must be mixed with paint to that the paint surface is quite thin and there are no excessive marks left after the application. The care has to be taken that there is no loss of adhesion in the case of old work. A good under coat should be such that after it’s drying, no clogging marks should be produced when it is rubbed with a sand paper. As this rubbing is essential before the application of any finishing coat. The tearing away of the film will result in damage, which is difficult to rectify. And also the color of the under coat should match with the finishing coat. 4.7.4 FINISHING COAT The finishing coat attains the color that is required to be on the surface. The choice of the finishing material depends upon the position where this has to be applied. I.e. The type of finish required whether external or internal surface and whether glossy or matte and atmospheric condition etc. By using various colored paints, finishing can be done in different methods. All these coats were important for giving a desired protection and a pleasing appearance. 4.7.5 INSTRUMENTS USED FOR PAINTINGS ? Grinder (with Diamond Wheel or Cup Wheel) ? Scraper ? Trowel ? Roller ? Brush 4.7.6 SURFACE PREPARATION ? The surface have to be dry and free from dust, dry salts, oil, grease and other sources of contamination. ? Smooth glossy surface is treated at with bonding agent. ? More than 5mm thickness of error on the walls must be plastered again. 4.7.7 METHOD OF PAINTING ? Before starting the painting work all surface should be free from dust &amp; should be well cleaned. 43 ? Then apply pre-coat using finishing trowel &amp; Scraper (Applying have to be done directions, If the 1st coat and 2nd coat are applied in perpendicular directions. ? After that sand paper is used for rub well pre coat surface. (Using 500 w-1000 w flash light &amp; 120-240 grit sand paper). ? Then it should be completed alignment of the edges and corners. ? Then apply paints 1st coat and patches work (using roller and brush). ? Finally apply paint 2nd coat. 4.7.8 TECHNICAL DETAILS ? Apply with roller, brush or air spray. ? Liquefy with a minimum of 20% volume for brush ability with clean water. ? Paint consumption: Theoretical – 15m2 per liter. ? Recoating interval – minimum 2 hours. ? Dry <a href="javascript:openDSC(3303872303, 1179, '1366');" onmouseover="doRollover(26);" onmouseout="undoRollover(26);" id="1366" name="26" style="color:#ff6600" class="#ff6600"><span class="b-ref">26</span>time – Touch dry, 10-15 minutes. Hard dry, 1</a> hour. 4.8 TILING 4.8.1 INTRODUCTION Tiling is the most popular floor finishing work. Floors and walls laid with ceramic tiles are becoming very popular these days. Different types of tiles are available in the market as ceramic, granite, marble etc. It should be selected the right tile for different uses and they should be laid by experienced workmen for good results. In my site, they used ceramic tile for bath rooms and panel room and granite tiles for other areas. As flooring can be an expensive item, much care should be taken in its selection and construction. Generally these tiles are said with continuous joints in both directions as it will be easy to clean the joints. And tiles can be obtaining in wide range of patterns as well as sizes. <a href="javascript:openDSC(936832637, 1179, '1348');" onmouseover="doRollover(18);" onmouseout="undoRollover(18);" id="1348" name="18" style="color:#cc6600" class="#cc6600"><span class="b-ref">18</span>Tile floors are among the popular<span> glamorous </span>material for some time now.</a><a href="javascript:openDSC(936832637, 1179, '1350');" onmouseover="doRollover(18);" onmouseout="undoRollover(18);" id="1350" name="18" style="color:#cc6600" class="#cc6600"><span class="b-ref">18</span>Over time, tile flooring has also become subject for customization and they are now offered in customized designs, special effects and distinct glazes.<span> The final selection </span>of the</a> floor and wall tile may be done after considering the following matters, • It should be durable. • It should be easy to clean. • It should be fire resistance • As far as possible it should be noiseless. • It should have good appearance. • There are should be a low maintenance cost • It should be free from dampness <a href="javascript:openDSC(2634713287, 1840, '2502');" onmouseover="doRollover(16);" onmouseout="undoRollover(16);" id="2502" name="16" style="color:#cc9900" class="#cc9900"><span class="b-ref">16</span>Ceramic Tiles Ceramic tiles are made of natural organic materials and fired<span> in </span>very high temperatures.

First fill all cracks in the surfaces using approved crack filler. Then clean the floors of all remaining dust and loose particles, timber strips, concrete or mortar particles and pins like that. Then the floor should be washed to remove all dust. Then the tile bed can be laid down. 4.8.3.2 Tile Bed Floor:-After cleaning the floor tile bed can be laid down. In our site we use 1:3cement: mortar bedding. Chemifix or cement dust is added before laying the bed as adhesive. And after dry the bed completely it can be laid tiles. Guide Points should be placed such that, • Maintaining the Slope to the gulley. • Maintaining the Floor Level Continuity • Maintaining the Floor Level Drops • Maintaining the Correct Door Opening sizes. Wall: - Before plastering the dots (guide points) we have to consider about plumbing points. Wall is plastered with a cement mortar 1:3 to a thickness of about 12mm. When the plastering has hardened and is ready for the tile fixing, it is must be wetted. Guide Points should be placed such that, • Maintaining the verticality &amp; even surface of the wall. • Plumbing out lets are flushed to the tile surface. Screed should be leveled, float &amp; finished with a steel trowel, to a hard &amp; even level surface and curing is done for a minimum of ten days. Before laying the tile bed level pegs have to be arranging to keep the same level and in bathrooms to keep the slope according to the approved drawings. Fig.30: fixing level pegs 4.8.3.3 Tile Marking Marking for Tiling should be done on the tile bed according to the Tile Drawing, such that, • Corners are not get fouled. • Tile groves to be continued. • Avoid having odd sized tile pieces at edges. Thereafter Tiling can be commenced. Main purpose of providing a tile line is to manage grooves in a tile line in both wall and floor. Normally a tile line is selected in the center of the tiling area. 47 Fig.31 &amp; 32: tile marking 4.8.3.4 Applying Adhesive <a href="javascript:openDSC(2634713287, 1840, '2505');" onmouseover="doRollover(16);" onmouseout="undoRollover(16);" id="2505" name="16" style="color:#cc9900" class="#cc9900"><span class="b-ref">16</span>Cement mortar can be used as a low cost alternative to adhesives.</a><a href="javascript:openDSC(2634713287, 1840, '2507');" onmouseover="doRollover(16);" onmouseout="undoRollover(16);" id="2507" name="16" style="color:#cc9900" class="#cc9900"><span class="b-ref">16</span>Use the type of trowel on the adhesive.

Fig.33: Adhesive applied tile Fig.34: Tiles positioned against battens 4.8.4 GRANITE TILE INSTALLING Before starting the granite tiling, it should be cleaned the selected area. After removing the dust on the floor, spread the some adhesive like Chemifix (in my site, they used small quantities of cement &amp; water as the adhesive) on those areas. Then put the motor (1:3cement: sand) and place some tiles in a row along one line without spacing between two tiles in same level. After adjusted them remove the tiles and put adhesive again (Chemifix or cement dust with water). Then keep the granite tile on it and press the tiles gently into the floor until coming the all tiles in same necessary level. It can be checked by using spirit level. 4.8.5 INSTALLING THE TILE SKIRTING The final step of installing granite tile is to install the skirt. The idea of the skirt tile is to completely cover the edge and protect them from the top of the granite tiles. This is the piece that will hide the rough edge of the granite. The skirt should exactly match the granite color. Fig.35: Granite tiled floor 4.8.6 GROUTING THE JOINTS The surface (floor or wall) was cleaned before apply tile grout for joints, where tiles had been laid. Specially clean that groove in tiles which are available in various colors. The tile grout mixture was made as follows: • Clean water was added into powder and mix to thick creamy consistency. And about 15 minutes kept that mixture and before use it was remixed. • Tile grout was compressed into the tile grooves, and after that surplus grout was removed from the face. Then after the tiles had been grouted wet the tilled surface firmly. 4.8.7 EQUIPMENTS USED FOR TILING Fig.36 &amp; 37 Fig.38 &amp; 39 Fig.40 &amp; 41 4.9 EXPANSION JOINT 4.9.1 INTRODUCTION <a href="javascript:openDSC(1961765867, 1840, '228');" onmouseover="doRollover(7);" onmouseout="undoRollover(7);" id="228" name="7" style="color:#009cff" class="#009cff"><span class="b-ref">7</span>An expansion joint is a mid-structure separation designed to<span> decrease </span>stress on building materials caused<span> in </span>building<span> construction by building </span>movement<span> like, </span><span>• </span>Thermal expansion and contraction caused by temperature changes,<span>• Seismic events, • </span>Sway caused by wind etc.</a> It marks a gap through whole building because of the joint bisects the whole structure like walls, floors, roofs, planters, plazas, etc. In my site it makes only in the floor. <a href="javascript:openDSC(1961765867, 1840, '239');" onmouseover="doRollover(7);" onmouseout="undoRollover(7);" id="239" name="7" style="color:#009cff" class="#009cff"><span class="b-ref">7</span>This gap must be filled to restore the waterproofing, fire proofing, air barrier, roof membrane, trafficable surface and other functions of the building elements it bisects.<span> The </span>expansion joint</a> is more applicably <a href="javascript:openDSC(1961765867, 1840, '244');" onmouseover="doRollover(7);" onmouseout="undoRollover(7);" id="244" name="7" style="color:#009cff" class="#009cff"><span class="b-ref">7</span>encompasses the fact that building movement results in both compression and expansion of the material installed.<span> As an </span>example, when a structure heats up, the building materials</a><a href="javascript:openDSC(1961765867, 1840, '246');" onmouseover="doRollover(7);" onmouseout="undoRollover(7);" id="246" name="7" style="color:#009cff" class="#009cff"><span class="b-ref">7</span>expand.

(In my site they used 2nd one) 4.9.2 INSTALLATION OF EXPANSION JOINTS First of all, it should be cut the small drain on the floor for expansion joint. In my site it is cut the drain 40mm depth and with 20mm width (half of depth) by using grinder. After cutting it, it should remove all dust and cleaned well. Then put the closed cell polyethylene joint backer rods in to the drain and push down. After that, apply primer (FR 200primer) on two walls of drain with using small brush. After few minutes, pour the sealant on the rod, until remaining the 10mm (half of the width of the drain) from the top level. In my site, they used mixture of FR 200 pouring grade black and FR 200 curing as the sealant. Then install the extruded aluminum joint cover plate. After installing that, it is wanted to keep some weights on it to slick well and it take 2-4 hours to stick well.

In case of construction industry, the workers are more vulnerable to face accidents and needs taking actions in making it less by taking proper precautions for safety. 4.12.1 SAFETY EQUIPMENTS USED IN THE SITE There are many safety equipments that are very necessary in each type of construction site. Some of them are; Safety Helmet It should be worn safety helmet to protect our head from the some shock load. This helmet made by hard plastic shell and chin guard. We should be worn the safety helmet with that chin guard by fixing correctly. Fig.45 Safety Shoes and Safety Boots. It can be safe the feet by wearing safety shoes from the sharp metal pieces, hot hazards, accident, chemical hazards also shock load on the foot. There is a metal cover in the toe of the shoe that protects our fingers from the heavy loads. Also, these shoes resist to the water, electricity and we can walk on the oily floor without risking. Normally safety boots are used when concreting at the site. Head Shield/Hand Shields Fig.46 It is used in the welding. Worker can protect those eyes from the arc. Earplugs Fig.47 They are used to protect ears from the loud sounds. When workers are working with the machinery, this needs to wear ear protections. Eye Protectors (Goggles) Fig.48 When workers are grinding a metal part they should wear an eye protecting goggle. If not our eyes may be damaged due to striking small metal parts. Gloves Gloves are used to protect the hand. There are various types in site. Fig.49: Some banners that shows at site 5.0 CONCLUSION In conclusion, there are many things that I have experience and learnt during the three month of internship of a proposed transit/duty free shopping area expansion at Bandaranayake International Airport, Katunayake in Sri Lanka. By working this site provided me with good knowledge about construction. The whole training period was very interesting, instructive and challenging. In my second training, I got an opportunity to work with talented project manager who has wide experience, site engineers and store keepers. I have got a lot of experience by working with skilled masons, unskilled labours, and machine operators. In here, I was able to gain experience and confidence to face the challenges, when it will be practicing as young civil engineer in future, through my internship. I believe that, I have achieved a lot of things that I expected from the internship. And I am well satisfied with my training. 6.0 REFERENCES 1. http://www.sankenconstruction.com/ 2. http://www.wikihow.com/Tile-a-Bathroom-Floor 3. http://www.todayshomeowner.com/how-to-install-a-granite-tile-countertop/ 4. http://www.dechom.com/ceiling-tile.html 5. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_joint 6. http://en.wikipedia.org/ 7.0 APPENDIX 1) The floor layout before demolition 2) Construction <a href="javascript:openDSC(395716639, 1840, '2210');" onmouseover="doRollover(25);" onmouseout="undoRollover(25);" id="2210" name="25" style="color:brown" class="brown"><span class="b-ref">25</span>areas (Area 1, Area 2, Area 3<span> and </span>Area 4)<span> or Granite tiling </span>area</a> 3) Ceiling height and grid layout 4) Mineral fiber ceiling tile layout 5) The measurement sheet of painting area 1 2 5 7 8 9 10 12 13 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 30 32 33 34 35 36 37 39 40 41 44 45 46 49 50 51 52 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66
